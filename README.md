The data set has been extracted from the link - https://data.unicef.org/ . 
The dashboard consists of analysis of Child mortality rate amongst Burkina Faso, Nigeria and Sierra Leone regions of South Africa, for the Year 2013. 
The analysis is based on the data of the Literacy Rate by Gender, malnutrition rate, %age  Underweight Children (2013), Under 5 CMR by Malnutrition (2013), %age Severe Wasting in Children (2013). 
The following are the findings of the analysis 
We analyzed that the western African regions the Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone has had high malnutrition rate with the highest being Nigeria.

We observe from the analysis, that in the western African region, the higher malnutrition rate has led to higher rate of mortality in children below the age of 5.

The literacy rate in these regions may be a possible cause for the malnutrition in these areas especially in Nigeria as it is relatively high.

From the literacy report, illiteracy amongst women could be one of the reasons for lower malnutrition and higher child mortality rate.
